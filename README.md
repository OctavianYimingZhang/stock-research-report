# stock-research-report

A self-contained public-company deep research report Skill.

The Skill produces analyst style deep research reports with four integrated
modules:

1. business-model logic
2. valuation, including assets, orders/backlog, debt, and dilution
3. short-seller risk
4. technical analysis and trade planning

This repository has been refactored from the old architecture that stitched
together four standalone Skills. The Skill no longer depends at runtime on:

- `Stock-Analysis-Skill`
- `valuation-calculator`
- `short-seller-risk-analysis`
- `technical-analysis-patterns`

The strongest methods from those repositories are now consolidated into this
repository's reference framework.

## Usage

```text
Use $stock-research-report to analyze [TICKER]
```

Optional inputs:

- company name, exchange, and currency
- Bloomberg, FactSet, or Capital IQ screenshots
- filings, investor presentations, or earnings-call transcripts
- K-line screenshots or OHLCV data
- user focus areas such as valuation, short-seller risk, order quality, or
  technical entry

## Output Structure

The report uses this fixed structure:

1. Company Overview
2. Business Model Logic
3. Operations, Customers, And Orders
4. Financials, Assets, And Debt
5. Valuation
6. Short-Seller Risk
7. Technical Analysis
8. Risk Factors
9. Trade Plan

## Evidence Priority

Use sources in this order:

1. issuer filings, exchange notices, and regulator records
2. issuer investor relations, earnings-call transcripts, and formal guidance
3. government, regulator, industry association, customer, and partner
   disclosures
4. reliable market-data providers and terminal data
5. high-quality secondary research

User-provided historical reports are style, structure, and depth references
only. They are not factual sources for a new report.

## Core Rules

- Do not invent data, dates, contracts, customers, orders, or target prices.
- State data gaps explicitly.
- Use one primary valuation method; other methods are sanity checks only.
- Valuation must cover assets, orders/backlog, debt, cash, and dilution.
- Short-seller risk must cover customer/contract authenticity, revenue
  recognition, cash-flow quality, related parties, audit quality, insider
  behavior, equity financing, and regulatory risk.
- Technical analysis must output trend, pattern, support/resistance, entry, stop
  loss, and take-profit levels.
