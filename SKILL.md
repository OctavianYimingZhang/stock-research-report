# Stock Research Report — Orchestration Skill

## Purpose

Produce a single, cohesive deep research report that reads like it was written by **one analyst with conviction** — not four separate skills concatenated. This skill orchestrates `stock-analysis`, `risk-analysis`, `technical-analysis`, and `valuation-calculator` in parallel, then **WEAVES** their full outputs into one narrative-driven document with an opinionated trade plan at the end.

## Core Philosophy (Read This First)

The output must be an **opinionated trade memo**, not a forensic audit. Four principles govern this:

1. **PRESERVE ALL MATERIAL CONTENT** — Every specific data point, named customer, dated management quote, contract number, capacity figure, catalyst date, and valuation input from the four sub-reports **must survive** into the final report. The previous version of this skill "extracted top 3" items and destroyed most content. That is a BUG. The synthesis step is **reorganization**, not **reduction**.

2. **THEMED STRUCTURE, NOT NUMBERED PARTS** — No "第一部分/第二部分/第三部分/第四部分" structure. No visible skill seams. Sub-skill outputs become content *blocks* that get woven into themed sections (业务逻辑 / 运营逻辑 / 客户与订单 / 财务数据 / 估值 / 技术 / 交易计划).

3. **ONE CONVICTED VOICE** — Use "我们"/"我认为"/"从数据看" patterns. Take a side. Never use "概率加权公允价值", "数据充分性说明", "本报告不构成投资建议" mid-report, or matrix-style conclusions. End with a **trade plan** (entry / stop / first target / second target / position size), not a summary table.

4. **BOTTOM-UP QUANTIFICATION WHERE POSSIBLE** — For commodity, industrial, and capacity-driven companies, the report must include **unit-volume × price × cost** math and **operating leverage decomposition** (incremental margin walk). This is the single biggest gap vs. professional analyst reports.

## When to Use

Activate when the user asks for a comprehensive research report, deep dive, or analyst-style analysis of a public company. This skill replaces the pattern of calling four skills sequentially and concatenating outputs.

## WORKFLOW

### Phase 1: Parallel Dispatch

Launch ALL FOUR analysis skills **simultaneously** as parallel agents. Each agent works independently with the same ticker, user-provided context (Bloomberg screenshots, focus areas, etc.), and an explicit instruction to **OUTPUT EVERYTHING THEY FOUND** — do not pre-compress.

Use the Agent tool with `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` for all four. Dispatch as one message with four tool calls.

**Agent 1 — Fundamental Analysis** (stock-analysis skill)
```
Analyze [TICKER] by invoking the stock-analysis skill. Output the FULL analysis — do NOT pre-compress or self-summarize. Required content blocks:

- Core thesis (one paragraph, opinionated)
- Business Logic Transformation (old → new, 2-4 paragraphs with specific data points)
- Operating Logic (capacity ramp, capex cadence, utilization targets, named facilities)
- Named customer list with revenue share and strategic significance
- Contract/backlog walk with delivery cadence (contract-by-contract if disclosed)
- Management quotes from recent 2-3 earnings calls WITH DATES AND SPEAKER NAMES
- 3-year P&L table + forward model with explicit growth drivers in column headers
- Bottom-up revenue bridge for next year (segment × growth rate = incremental)
- Competitive positioning (3-5 named peers, market share, differentiator)
- Macro-to-company transmission (top 3 factors with specific mechanism)
- Forward catalyst calendar with SPECIFIC DATES
- Unresolved items with impact level

Output everything in full prose and tables. I will re-organize — do not omit material content in an attempt to be "concise".
```

**Agent 2 — Short-Seller Risk** (risk-analysis skill)
```
Run the short-seller risk analysis skill on [TICKER] in EMBEDDED MODE (unless 3+ red flags fire, in which case use FULL AUDIT MODE).

Required output:
- Composite grade (A-F) with one-sentence verdict
- Named red flags with evidence (if any) — NOT a scored rubric, prose
- Named green flags with evidence
- Governance observations that belong in the business-logic or debt sections of the final report (e.g., "auditor upgraded Baker Tilly → PwC", "insider selling pattern", "state of incorporation change reflects capital structure optimization")

If EMBEDDED MODE: output as ~200 words of prose that can slot into the financial-quality section. If FULL AUDIT MODE: output full dashboard.

Do not output a "Risk Score Dashboard" table unless full audit mode is triggered.
```

**Agent 3 — Technical Analysis** (technical-analysis skill)
```
Run the technical-analysis skill on [TICKER]. Output:

- Monthly / weekly / daily trend in one line each
- Current primary pattern (from the 8 patterns) with breakout status
- 2-3 key support levels and 2-3 key resistance levels with brief reasoning
- Volume confirmation status at current or recent breakout
- Alignment with fundamental thesis in one sentence (aligned / divergent / neutral)
- **Trade plan: entry zone, stop loss, first take-profit, second take-profit** (CSIQ/UUUU/UAMY format)

Do NOT output a Wyckoff-phase table in the report — translate to plain Chinese (投降/反弹/回测/突破/上升). Do NOT use the "形态识别/突破成交量确认/关键价位/Wyckoff/综合判断" 5-subsection structure — that's for analysis, not for the final report.

Target length when synthesized: 150-200 words + one price-level table.
```

**Agent 4 — Valuation** (valuation-calculator skill)
```
Run the valuation-calculator skill on [TICKER]. CRITICAL RULES:

1. Pick ONE primary method appropriate for the company archetype:
   - Semiconductor cyclical → mid-cycle EPS × 10-year average P/E (TER pattern)
   - Growth foundry / specialty semi → forward EV/EBITDA with multiple-expansion thesis (TSEM pattern)
   - Mining/commodity → lb/ton × commodity price × margin → EBITDA × peer EV/EBITDA (UUUU/UAMY pattern)
   - Turnaround → P/FCF or replacement value
   - High-growth SaaS → EV/Revenue with Rule-of-40 check
2. Show every input of the primary method with sources.
3. Other methods are at most a 2-line sanity check, NOT equal citizens.
4. Do NOT produce a "probability-weighted fair value" average across 9 methods.
5. State the catalyst that re-rates the multiple from current to target (earnings beat, contract win, capacity milestone, rate cut).
6. For commodity companies, bottom-up unit math comes BEFORE any multiple work.
7. For multi-segment companies, do SOTP with geographic/political risk discounts where relevant.

Output: primary method derivation, bull/base/bear in prose (one sentence each), target price with explicit method label, peer comparison table (3-5 peers).
```

### Phase 2: Content Inventory (NOT Extraction)

After all four agents return, build a **content inventory** — a full list of every material fact, quote, number, date, customer name, competitor, catalyst, and valuation input from the four outputs. Think of this as indexing, not summarizing.

**Inventory checklist** — every item below must be collected from sub-reports into the final report:

**From Fundamental Analysis:**
- [ ] Core thesis sentence (verbatim or tightened, not rewritten)
- [ ] Business logic transformation narrative (full — 2-4 paragraphs)
- [ ] Every named customer with revenue share
- [ ] Every named competitor with comparison point
- [ ] Every dated management quote (speaker + date preserved)
- [ ] Revenue breakdown table (all segments, all years shown)
- [ ] Capacity/facility names with ramp schedules
- [ ] Backlog / contract numbers
- [ ] Every forward catalyst with date
- [ ] Every unresolved item
- [ ] Forward P&L model (all rows)

**From Short-Seller Risk:**
- [ ] Composite grade + one-line verdict
- [ ] Every named red flag with evidence
- [ ] Every named green flag with evidence
- [ ] Governance observations that belong in business / debt sections

**From Technical Analysis:**
- [ ] Monthly / weekly / daily trend assessment
- [ ] Primary pattern name + breakout status
- [ ] All support/resistance levels
- [ ] Volume confirmation status
- [ ] Alignment-with-fundamentals sentence
- [ ] Trade plan numbers (entry, stop, TP1, TP2)

**From Valuation:**
- [ ] Primary method name (verbatim)
- [ ] Every input of the primary method with source
- [ ] Target price number
- [ ] Bull/base/bear scenarios (one sentence each)
- [ ] Peer comparison table
- [ ] Multiple re-rating catalyst

**Anti-truncation rule (CRITICAL):** If any item from the checklist is missing, re-dispatch to the relevant sub-agent and ask for the specific missing item. Do NOT write the final report with gaps. If an item is legitimately unavailable ("customer names not disclosed in 10-K"), document that inline in the relevant section — do NOT silently drop it.

---

### Phase 3: Narrative Composition (Weave, Don't Staple)

Compose the final report using the **themed structure** in `references/report-format.md`. The sub-reports contribute content *blocks* that get woven into themed sections — they do NOT become standalone chapters with their own headers.

**Weaving rules:**

1. **ONE narrative voice throughout.** The report reads as if one analyst with conviction wrote all of it.

2. **Story-first structure.** Lead with the business logic transformation — this is what makes the report interesting. Financial tables support the story; they do not replace it.

3. **Embed, don't append.** Short-seller findings, technical analysis, and valuation are WOVEN INTO the narrative. They do NOT appear as separate appendices with "第一部分/第二部分" labels.
   - Short-seller risk becomes 1-2 sentences inside 财务数据 (if grade A-B) or a full paragraph (if grade C+).
   - Technical analysis becomes 1-2 paragraphs + one small price-level table inside 技术分析.
   - Valuation becomes 2-3 paragraphs + one peer table inside 估值情况.
   - Governance observations from risk analysis go into 业务逻辑重构 or 负债结构 where they make narrative sense.

4. **Opinionated conclusion with explicit trade plan.** The report MUST end with a concrete trade plan. Use the format in `references/trade-plan-template.md`. Required fields:
   - 评级 (买入/持有/观望/卖出)
   - 建议仓位 (X-Y% of portfolio)
   - 入场区间 ($X-$Y with reason)
   - 止损位 ($Z with what invalidates thesis)
   - 第一止盈位 ($A with method)
   - 第二止盈位 ($B with method)
   - 90 天内最重要催化剂 (one event)
   - 做空风险 (one letter grade + one line)
   
   **Do NOT end with a summary matrix.** Prose only.

5. **Length target: 3,000-5,000 Chinese characters = 10-15 pages.** Do not compress below 3,000 characters — that means you lost content. Do not exceed 5,000 characters — that means you stapled sub-reports without weaving.

6. **Strip skill vocabulary.** Before finalizing, scan for and remove any occurrence of: "数据充分性", "value_creating", "Claim Gate", "置信度", "Red Flag Inventory", "Commercial Evidence Table", "Conditional Judgment", "概率加权公允价值", "Meta-Question Self-Reflection", "第一部分/第二部分/第三部分/第四部分" headers, "本报告不构成投资建议" (except once at the very end), "Wyckoff Spring/SOS/LPS" (translate to plain Chinese).

7. **Generate .docx file.** Use the docx skill to output the final report as `[TICKER]_深度研究报告.docx`.

## REPORT STRUCTURE (Themed — Not Numbered Parts)

The final report follows the themed structure below. Read `references/report-format.md` for per-section depth guidance. **There are NO "第一部分/第二部分" headers.**

```
[Company Name]（[Ticker]）深度研究报告
[Subtitle: one-line thesis positioning — e.g., "AI 驱动下的业务逻辑重构与 2026 年市场估值展望"]

## 公司简介
[1-2 paragraphs. What it does, when founded, key stats. Context-setting only.
100-200 words.]

## 业务逻辑
[THE CORE SECTION — 2-4 paragraphs, 400-800 words.
Old logic → New logic → Why now → Endgame.
Include specific data points, management quotes with dates.
Weave in industry chain context naturally.

Capacity by facility, capex cadence, utilization targets.
Bottom-up unit economics for commodity/industrial names (use commodity-math-template.md).
Operating leverage decomposition: "from Q1 to Q4, revenue +$XM, net income +$YM, incremental margin ~Z%".
This section answers: "HOW does the business logic convert into P&L, and when?"]

## 客户与订单
[1-2 paragraphs + 1-2 tables, 300-500 words.
Named top-5 customers with revenue share and strategic significance.
Contract/backlog walk: $X backlog split by contract, with 2025 vs 2026 contribution.

EMBED the short-seller risk grade as one-line: "做空风险评级: [A/B/C/D/F]—[one-line verdict]"
If risk grade C+, expand to a full paragraph with named red flags.]

## 估值情况
[2-3 paragraphs + tables, 400-700 words.
Lead with the ONE primary valuation method (chosen by archetype).
Derivation with every input named: "2027E EPS $X × historical average P/E 29x = target $Y"
Peer comparison table (3-5 peers, 4-6 columns max).
Bull/base/bear in prose (one sentence each) — NOT a probability-weighted table.

Monthly / weekly / daily trend.
Current primary pattern with breakout status.
Key support (2) and resistance (2) levels.

NO Wyckoff vocabulary — translate to 投降 / 反弹 / 回测 / 突破 / 上升.
Do NOT re-explain the trade plan here — that's the final section.]

## 风险提示
[Bullet list, 3-5 items, 150-250 words.
Each risk: what it is, severity, what to watch for.

## STYLE ENFORCEMENT

Read `references/style-guide.md` for the complete style guide. Key rules:

### DO (Analyst Patterns)
- Write as one analyst with conviction. Take a side.
- Use "我们"/"我认为"/"从数据我们看到" for opinions and observations.
- Reference Bloomberg screenshots naturally when provided.
- Use **bold** for key numbers and conclusions.
- Keep paragraphs to 3-5 sentences max.
- Use specific numbers, not ranges when possible.
- End with a trade plan that has entry / stop / TP1 / TP2 / position size.

### DO NOT (Claude Patterns to Avoid)
- Do NOT start with "数据充分性说明" (embed confidence inline).
- Do NOT use "概率加权公允价值" or average 9 methods to get a number.
- Do NOT create separate "Commercial Evidence Table" sections.
- Do NOT create formal "Wyckoff Phase" tables with SC/AR/ST/Spring/SOS labels in the final report.
- Do NOT create "Red Flag Inventory" tables with scores.
- Do NOT create "Financial Quality Sub-Components A/B/C/D/E" as separate sections.
- Do NOT use "本技术分析为基本面分析的补充附录" or any disclaimer mid-report.
- Do NOT hedge conclusions with "需要进一步验证" without specifying what and when.
- Do NOT use section numbering like "第一部分: ..., 第二部分: ..."
- Do NOT repeat the company name/ticker in every section header.
- Do NOT end with a 4-row evaluation matrix. End with a trade plan in prose.

## ANTI-TRUNCATION VERIFICATION

Before finalizing the report, run this self-check:

1. **Customer names** — Did I include every named customer from the fundamental sub-report? If the sub-report named NVIDIA, Broadcom, DLA, Samsung, Hynix, TSMC, ASE, TI — are all of them in the final report?

2. **Management quotes** — Did every dated, attributed quote from the fundamental sub-report appear in the final report? (Not summarized, not paraphrased into oblivion — the actual quote with date and speaker.)

3. **Forward catalysts** — Every dated catalyst from the fundamental sub-report: is it in 业务逻辑 / 运营逻辑 / 交易计划 somewhere?

4. **Valuation inputs** — Every input of the primary valuation method: is it visible in 估值情况?

5. **Trade plan numbers** — Does the final report have explicit entry zone, stop, TP1, TP2, position size?

6. **Technical levels** — Are the 2-3 support and 2-3 resistance levels all in the report?

7. **Green flags** — Did the named green flags from the risk sub-report make it into the final report (embedded in 财务数据 or 业务逻辑)?

If ANY of these fail, the synthesis is broken. Fix it by re-weaving, not by adding a new appendix.

---

## OUTPUT

Generate the final report as a .docx file using the docx skill. The filename should be:
`[TICKER]_深度研究报告.docx`

If the user provides Bloomberg Terminal data (screenshots or text), integrate it directly into the relevant sections rather than listing it in an appendix.
