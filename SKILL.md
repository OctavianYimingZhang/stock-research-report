# Stock Research Report — Orchestration Skill

## Purpose

Produce a single, cohesive deep research report that reads like it was written by **one analyst with conviction** — not four separate skills concatenated. This compact Skill can use `stock-analysis`, `risk-analysis`, `technical-analysis`, and `valuation-calculator` as optional accelerators, but it must still work without them. The final output is a unified, evidence-bounded memo with an opinionated trade plan at the end.

## Canonical Contract

The report is governed by the canonical 12-section mainline structure in
`references/report-format.md`. Older companion Skills, local compact copies, and
outside prompts are inputs to distill, not runtime authorities. Integrate their
useful content as:

- verified evidence
- thesis-path replay
- opportunity route
- valuation bridge
- short-risk blocker
- technical/trade setup

Do not paste or expose sub-skill report structures in the final memo.

## Core Philosophy (Read This First)

The output must be an **opinionated trade memo**, not a forensic audit. Six principles govern this:

1. **PRESERVE ALL MATERIAL CONTENT** — Every specific data point, named customer, dated management quote, contract number, capacity figure, catalyst date, and valuation input from the four sub-reports **must survive** into the final report. The previous version of this skill "extracted top 3" items and destroyed most content. That is a BUG. The synthesis step is **reorganization**, not **reduction**.

2. **THEMED STRUCTURE, NOT NUMBERED PARTS** — No "第一部分/第二部分/第三部分/第四部分" structure. No visible skill seams. Sub-skill outputs become content *blocks* that get woven into themed sections (业务逻辑 / 运营逻辑 / 客户与订单 / 财务数据 / 估值 / 技术 / 交易计划).

3. **FIRST-PERSON ANALYST VOICE** — Use "我"/"我认为"/"我觉得"/"我们" at least **6 times per report** (mostly in 业务逻辑 / 估值 / 交易计划). Analysts plant themselves in the report; third-person summaries have no alpha. See `references/voice-and-conviction.md` for the full voice rule set.

4. **TRADER DECISIVENESS, NOT ACADEMIC HEDGING** — Take a side and commit. Single-posture ratings (买入 / 观望 / 回避), single-number target with upside multiple (`目标市值 100 亿,~2.5 倍`), declarative sentences. **Banned**: hedged stacks ("中性偏负,非高确信多头"), "on one hand / on the other", multi-method triangulation in the closing line, "概率加权公允价值", "数据充分性说明", mid-report disclaimers.

5. **BOTTOM-UP QUANTIFICATION WHERE POSSIBLE** — For commodity, industrial, and capacity-driven companies, the report must include **unit-volume × price × cost** math and **operating leverage decomposition** (incremental margin walk). Inline prose arithmetic ("390MW → 1700MW = 4.36×, 3200 万 × 4.36 = 1.36 亿/季度, 全年约 5.5 亿") wins over cold `Step 1 / Step 2 / Step 3` structured tables.

6. **ONE NON-CONSENSUS TAKE** — Every report must contain a `我与市场的分歧 (Where I Differ from Consensus)` paragraph (1-2 sentences): what the market is missing or mis-weighting. Reports that could be replaced by "market has priced it correctly" contain no alpha. See `references/voice-and-conviction.md` §Non-Consensus Discipline.

## When to Use

Activate when the user asks for a comprehensive research report, deep dive, or analyst-style analysis of a public company. This skill replaces the pattern of calling four skills sequentially and concatenating outputs.

## PRO REPORT UPGRADE RULES

These rules override the older generic company-profile flow.

1. **Start with the current repricing dispute.** Do not open with founding date,
   headquarters, or a generic business description unless identity itself is
   the investment issue.
2. **Replay outside thesis paths before drafting.** Public articles, user notes,
   and analyst writeups can explain why the market is watching a stock, but
   they are not evidence. Extract the causal chain, list missing proof, verify
   material claims with filings, company disclosures, regulator/government
   records, counterparty sources, and reliable market data, then keep only the
   parts that survive.
3. **Route the opportunity archetype.** Classify the issuer as
   `scarcity_bottleneck`, `policy_protected_supply_chain`,
   `customer_funded_capacity_ramp`, `operating_leverage_recovery`,
   `order_backlog_repricing`, `strategic_asset_optional_value`,
   `levered_residual_equity`, `early_commercialization`,
   `mature_infrastructure_compounder`, or
   `commodity_or_resource_processing`. If no company-specific route is
   supported, cap the conclusion as industry beta or watchlist-only.
4. **Run the four-part opportunity test.** High-conviction reports must test
   demand expansion, scaling difficulty, bottleneck/scarcity, and
   commercialization visibility. If any part fails, cap the trade grade unless
   valuation already prices the stock as a discounted option.
5. **Use a mainline-driven report structure.** The report should explain why the
   stock exists now, where the chain bottleneck sits, why the company captures
   value, how orders convert into revenue and cash, what the current price
   already implies, and how the trade should be executed.

## COMPANION SKILLS (Optional Extensions)

Beyond the 4 core sub-skills (`stock-analysis`, `risk-analysis`, `technical-analysis`, `valuation-calculator`), this orchestrator can optionally dispatch 6 additional skills from `anthropics/financial-services-plugins` plus 1 multi-persona council pattern from `virattt/ai-hedge-fund`. Read `references/companion-skills.md` for full dispatch guidance and `references/investor-council.md` for the persona framework.

### When to Call Each Companion Skill

| User intent | Skill to invoke | Integration point |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Strengthen catalyst tracking | `catalyst-calendar` | Feeds into 催化剂 block of the final report |
| Follow up on a prior thesis | `thesis-tracker` | Standalone — produces a thesis-update memo, not a new deep research |
| Pre-earnings positioning | `earnings-preview` | Standalone — runs 1-2 weeks before earnings |
| Post-earnings assessment | `earnings-analysis` | Standalone — runs 0-3 days after earnings |
| Institutional peer comps | `comps-analysis` | Feeds into `valuation-calculator` Phase 4 (peer quartile table) |
| Excel-grade DCF model | `dcf-model` | Feeds into `valuation-calculator` DCF sanity check |
| Multi-persona second opinion | `investor-council` (in-file pattern) | Appended to report BEFORE 交易计划 |
| Bull/bear debate | `investor-council` with bull/bear split | Crux verdict feeds into 交易计划 stance |

### How to Dispatch Companion Skills

**Direct skill invocation** (use the Skill tool):

```
Skill tool with skill: "catalyst-calendar" and args describing ticker + horizon
Skill tool with skill: "thesis-tracker" and args describing prior thesis + new data point
Skill tool with skill: "earnings-preview" and args describing ticker + reporting date
Skill tool with skill: "earnings-analysis" and args describing ticker + reported results
Skill tool with skill: "comps-analysis" and args describing target + peer set
Skill tool with skill: "dcf-model" and args describing ticker + assumptions
```

These skills must be installed at `~/.claude/skills/` (one-time setup — see `references/companion-skills.md` §Installation).

**Council mode dispatch** (N parallel Agent calls):

When the user requests "council mode", "second opinion", "multi-persona", or "bull/bear debate", dispatch the investor council as an OPTIONAL additional parallel phase AFTER Phase 1 completes. Each persona runs as a separate `general-purpose` agent with the persona-specific checklist from `references/investor-council.md`. Output is a disagreement matrix + crux verdict, appended to the report BEFORE 交易计划. See `references/investor-council.md` §Council Workflow for exact dispatch pattern.

### Default Mode vs Extended Mode

- **Default mode** (99% of requests): Run only the 4 core sub-skills. Companion skills stay idle. Produce one deep research report.
- **Extended mode** (explicit user request): Run 4 core sub-skills + 1-2 companion skills inline (e.g., catalyst-calendar for richer events, or investor-council for contentious names). Composition time and cost increase, but output depth increases proportionally.

Do NOT default to extended mode — extra skill dispatches have meaningful cost and only pay off for complex or contentious situations.

---

## WORKFLOW

### Phase 0: Research Path Replay And Opportunity Routing

Before dispatching the four core analyses, build a compact research map:

- outside thesis paths: what each outside source believes, causal chain,
  claimed bottleneck, claimed order/customer proof, unsupported claims, and
  falsification test
- primary-source check: filings, transcripts, investor relations, exchange or
  regulator records, government sources, customer/partner disclosures, and
  reliable market data
- opportunity archetype: selected route, evidence burden, section emphasis, and
  valuation implication
- four-part test: demand expansion, scaling difficulty, bottleneck/scarcity,
  and commercialization visibility

Pass this map to every sub-agent. Tell each sub-agent which claims are verified,
which are hypotheses, and which are blocked by missing evidence.

### Phase 1: Parallel Dispatch

If the companion analysis skills are installed and useful, launch all four
analysis skills **simultaneously** as parallel agents. If they are unavailable,
perform the same four analyses directly inside this Skill. Each analysis works
from the same ticker, user-provided context, and source boundary, with an
explicit instruction to **OUTPUT EVERYTHING MATERIAL** — do not pre-compress.

Use the Agent tool with `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` for all four. Dispatch as one message with four tool calls.

**Agent 1 — Fundamental Analysis** (stock-analysis skill)
```
Analyze [TICKER] by invoking the stock-analysis skill. Output the FULL analysis — do NOT pre-compress or self-summarize. Required content blocks:

- Core thesis (one paragraph, opinionated)
- Business Logic Transformation (old → new, 2-4 paragraphs with specific data points)
- Operating Logic (capacity ramp, capex cadence, utilization targets, named facilities)
- Named customer list with revenue share and strategic significance
- Contract/backlog walk with delivery cadence (contract-by-contract if disclosed)
- Management quotes from recent 2-3 earnings calls WITH DATES AND SPEAKER NAMES
- 3-year P&L table + forward model with explicit growth drivers in column headers
- Bottom-up revenue bridge for next year (segment × growth rate = incremental)
- Competitive positioning (3-5 named peers, market share, differentiator)
- Macro-to-company transmission (top 3 factors with specific mechanism)
- Forward catalyst calendar with SPECIFIC DATES
- Unresolved items with impact level

Output everything in full prose and tables. I will re-organize — do not omit material content in an attempt to be "concise".
```

**Agent 2 — Short-Seller Risk** (risk-analysis skill)
```
Run the short-seller risk analysis skill on [TICKER] in EMBEDDED MODE (unless 3+ red flags fire, in which case use FULL AUDIT MODE).

Required output:
- Composite grade (A-F) with one-sentence verdict
- Named red flags with evidence (if any) — NOT a scored rubric, prose
- Named green flags with evidence
- Governance observations that belong in the business-logic or debt sections of the final report (e.g., "auditor upgraded Baker Tilly → PwC", "insider selling pattern", "state of incorporation change reflects capital structure optimization")

If EMBEDDED MODE: output as ~200 words of prose that can slot into the financial-quality section. If FULL AUDIT MODE: output full dashboard.

Do not output a "Risk Score Dashboard" table unless full audit mode is triggered.
```

**Agent 3 — Technical Analysis** (technical-analysis skill)
```
Run the technical-analysis skill on [TICKER]. Output:

- Monthly / weekly / daily trend in one line each
- Current primary pattern (from the 8 patterns) with breakout status
- 2-3 key support levels and 2-3 key resistance levels with brief reasoning
- Volume confirmation status at current or recent breakout
- Alignment with fundamental thesis in one sentence (aligned / divergent / neutral)
- **Trade plan: entry zone, stop loss, first take-profit, second take-profit** (CSIQ/UUUU/UAMY format)

Do NOT output a Wyckoff-phase table in the report — translate to plain Chinese (投降/反弹/回测/突破/上升). Do NOT use the "形态识别/突破成交量确认/关键价位/Wyckoff/综合判断" 5-subsection structure — that's for analysis, not for the final report.

Target length when synthesized: 150-200 words + one price-level table.
```

**Agent 4 — Valuation** (valuation-calculator skill)
```
Run the valuation-calculator skill on [TICKER]. CRITICAL RULES:

1. Pick ONE primary method appropriate for the company archetype:
   - Semiconductor cyclical → mid-cycle EPS × 10-year average P/E (TER pattern)
   - Growth foundry / specialty semi → forward EV/EBITDA with multiple-expansion thesis (TSEM pattern)
   - Mining/commodity → lb/ton × commodity price × margin → EBITDA × peer EV/EBITDA (UUUU/UAMY pattern)
   - Pipeline biotech / pre-revenue pharma / E&P reserves → risk-adjusted NPV (rNPV) with stage-specific PoS (see `references/rnpv-calculator.md` in valuation skill)
   - Turnaround → P/FCF or replacement value
   - High-growth SaaS → EV/Revenue with Rule-of-40 check
2. Show every input of the primary method with sources, with MATH DONE INLINE IN PROSE ("2027E EPS $X × 29x = $Y") not just in tables.
3. Other methods are at most a 2-line sanity check, NOT equal citizens.
4. Do NOT produce a "probability-weighted fair value" average across 9 methods.
5. State the catalyst that re-rates the multiple from current to target (earnings beat, contract win, capacity milestone, rate cut) with a SPECIFIC date or quarter.
6. For commodity companies, bottom-up unit math comes BEFORE any multiple work.
7. For multi-segment companies, do SOTP with geographic/political risk discounts where relevant.
8. **FINAL LINE REQUIREMENT**: Your output must end with a single-number target + upside multiple. Format: "目标价 $X (约 Y.Zx,对应 [method + input])。" or "目标市值 $X 亿,~Y 倍空间。" **Banned**: "三法收敛区间", "综合公允价值", "概率加权", any range-only closing line.

Output: primary method derivation with inline arithmetic, bull/base/bear in prose (one sentence each), single-number target, peer comparison table (3-5 peers), explicit multiple re-rating catalyst with date.
```

---

### Phase 2: Content Inventory (NOT Extraction)

After all four agents return, build a **content inventory** — a full list of every material fact, quote, number, date, customer name, competitor, catalyst, and valuation input from the four outputs. Think of this as indexing, not summarizing.

**Inventory checklist** — every item below must be collected from sub-reports into the final report:

**From Fundamental Analysis:**
- [ ] Core thesis sentence (verbatim or tightened, not rewritten)
- [ ] Business logic transformation narrative (full — 2-4 paragraphs)
- [ ] Every named customer with revenue share
- [ ] Every named competitor with comparison point
- [ ] Every dated management quote (speaker + date preserved)
- [ ] Revenue breakdown table (all segments, all years shown)
- [ ] Capacity/facility names with ramp schedules
- [ ] Backlog / contract numbers
- [ ] Every forward catalyst with date
- [ ] Every unresolved item
- [ ] Forward P&L model (all rows)

**From Short-Seller Risk:**
- [ ] Composite grade + one-line verdict
- [ ] Every named red flag with evidence
- [ ] Every named green flag with evidence
- [ ] Governance observations that belong in business / debt sections

**From Technical Analysis:**
- [ ] Monthly / weekly / daily trend assessment
- [ ] Primary pattern name + breakout status
- [ ] All support/resistance levels
- [ ] Volume confirmation status
- [ ] Alignment-with-fundamentals sentence
- [ ] Trade plan numbers (entry, stop, TP1, TP2)

**From Valuation:**
- [ ] Primary method name (verbatim)
- [ ] Every input of the primary method with source
- [ ] Target price number
- [ ] Bull/base/bear scenarios (one sentence each)
- [ ] Peer comparison table
- [ ] Multiple re-rating catalyst

**Anti-truncation rule (CRITICAL):** If any item from the checklist is missing, re-dispatch to the relevant sub-agent and ask for the specific missing item. Do NOT write the final report with gaps. If an item is legitimately unavailable ("customer names not disclosed in 10-K"), document that inline in the relevant section — do NOT silently drop it.

---

### Phase 3: Narrative Composition (Weave, Don't Staple)

Compose the final report using the **themed structure** in `references/report-format.md`. The sub-reports contribute content *blocks* that get woven into themed sections — they do NOT become standalone chapters with their own headers.

**Weaving rules:**

1. **ONE narrative voice throughout.** The report reads as if one analyst with conviction wrote all of it. First-person "我"/"我认为"/"我觉得"/"我们" must appear at least **6 times** across the report — mostly in 业务逻辑, 估值情况, 交易计划.

2. **Mainline-first structure.** Lead with why the stock exists now: demand expansion, chain bottleneck, company position, commercialization proof, and current-market-implied valuation. Business logic remains the core, but it must sit inside this causal chain.

3. **Narrative-tension opening (Core Conclusion).** Open with the repricing dispute in one sentence — the pivot, bottleneck, inflection, or mispricing. Corporate genealogy moves later. **Forbidden opener**: "XYZ 成立于 1912 年,总部位于..." **Required opener pattern**: "The market is repricing whether [verified bottleneck/order/ramp] can turn into [revenue/cash/earnings] before [current valuation] already discounts it."

4. **Inline prose arithmetic.** Valuation and operating leverage math must appear **inside prose sentences** with explicit operators and parenthetical asides:
   - GOOD: *"50 × 0.62 = 31 亿。然后因为现在这个 31 亿是按照 688472 当下市值计算的... 我们保守计算,直接把 31 亿的股权价值砍到 15 亿。(我认为这已经很保守了。)"*
   - BAD: `| 项目 | 计算 | 结果 |` (cold ledger table with no reasoning)

   Free-standing valuation tables are allowed ONLY with a prose paragraph that walks through the numbers inline. Operating leverage chains must be **inline sentences**, NOT `Step 1 / Step 2 / Step 3 / Step 4 / Step 5` structured enumerations.

5. **Embed, don't append.** Short-seller findings, technical analysis, and valuation are WOVEN INTO the narrative. They do NOT appear as separate appendices with "第一部分/第二部分" labels.
   - Short-seller risk becomes 1-2 sentences inside 财务数据 (if grade A-B) or a full paragraph (if grade C+).
   - Technical analysis becomes 1-2 paragraphs + one small price-level table inside 技术分析.
   - Valuation becomes 2-3 paragraphs + one peer table inside 估值情况.
   - Governance observations from risk analysis go into 业务逻辑重构 or 负债结构 where they make narrative sense.

6. **Mandatory "我与市场的分歧" (1-2 sentences, bolded).** Placed at the end of 业务逻辑 OR start of 估值情况. States explicitly what the market is missing or mis-weighting. Reports that could be replaced by "市场已正确定价" fail this check and must be revised.

7. **Single-number target in closing line.** The CLOSING LINE of 估值情况 must be one number + one upside multiple: `目前市值 40 亿,我们看到 100 亿,6 倍空间` or `目标价 ¥8,700 (~2.0×)`. Three-method triangulation is allowed in the body but NEVER in the closing sentence. **Banned closers**: `三法收敛区间 ¥7,230-8,700,主推基准 ¥8,700`, `综合 DCF/相对/SOTP 公允价值 $X-$Y`.

8. **Opinionated conclusion with explicit trade plan.** The report MUST end with a concrete trade plan. Use the format in `references/trade-plan-template.md`. Required fields:
   - 评级 (买入/持有/观望/卖出) — **one posture only, no stacked hedges**
   - 建议仓位 (X-Y% of portfolio) — single range, 5 percentage points max width
   - 入场区间 ($X-$Y with reason)
   - 止损位 ($Z with what invalidates thesis)
   - 第一止盈位 ($A with method)
   - 第二止盈位 ($B with method)
   - 90 天内最重要催化剂 (one event with specific date YYYY-MM or YYYY-Q#)
   - 做空风险 (one letter grade + one line)

   **Do NOT end with a summary matrix.** Prose only.

9. **Length target: 3,000-5,000 Chinese characters = 10-15 pages.** Do not compress below 3,000 characters — that means you lost content. Do not exceed 5,000 characters — that means you stapled sub-reports without weaving.

10. **Strip skill vocabulary AND templated phrases.** Before finalizing, scan for and remove ALL of:
    - Skill vocabulary: "数据充分性", "value_creating", "Claim Gate", "置信度", "Red Flag Inventory", "Commercial Evidence Table", "Conditional Judgment", "概率加权公允价值", "Meta-Question Self-Reflection", "第一部分/第二部分/第三部分/第四部分" headers, "本报告不构成投资建议" (except once at the very end), "Wyckoff Spring/SOS/LPS" (translate to plain Chinese).
    - **Templated transitions (NEW)**: "综上所述", "由此可见", "换言之", "综合来看", "值得关注的是", "读这个表的关键一句话：", "一句话总结：", "业务总结：", "综合评级", "核心判断：", "长话短说". These are Claude's tells — use plain prose or `总结：` + bullets.
    - **Hedge stacks (NEW)**: "中性偏负,非高确信多头", "持有偏积极买入", "观望 (Hold / Trade-Only)", "二元期权" as thesis descriptor, "非对称性极强" (overused), English-in-parens subsection labels ("Guidance", "Margin Story").

11. **Specific-date density.** Every major business driver paragraph must contain at least **one specific date (YYYY-MM or YYYY-Q#)**. Target: 10+ dated milestones across a report. Vague phrases like "in coming quarters" / "未来几个月" are BANNED.

12. **Risk section discipline.** 风险提示 is 2-4 items MAX in a named list. Each risk must link to an **observable signal to monitor**, not an abstract regulatory/FX/liquidity category. Drop symmetric 4-block Credit/Market/Operational/Regulatory templates — those are compliance output, not analyst output.

13. **Output format**: Default to markdown (.md) for easy review and diff. If the user asks for a Word document OR the task requires a shareable file for stakeholders, generate .docx using the `anthropic-skills:docx` skill as `[TICKER]_深度研究报告.docx`. Respect the user's requested format when specified.

---

## REPORT STRUCTURE (Themed — Not Numbered Parts)

The final report follows the themed structure below. Read `references/report-format.md` for per-section depth guidance. **There are NO "第一部分/第二部分" headers.**

```
[Company Name]（[Ticker]）深度研究报告
[Subtitle: one-line thesis positioning — e.g., "AI 驱动下的业务逻辑重构与 2026 年市场估值展望"]

## 公司简介
[80-150 words. OPEN with narrative tension (pivot, inflection, mispricing) in sentence 1 — NOT with founding date.
- GOOD opener: "这家源自澳洲的比特币矿工正在把算力卖给 AI 客户,一只脚在加密矿机上,另一只脚跨进 AI 算力云。"
- BAD opener: "XYZ 成立于 1912 年,总部位于岐阜县大垣市..."
Founding date, HQ, ticker, float can appear in sentence 3+ or a sidebar.
End with a one-line setup of what the report will argue.]

## 业务逻辑
[THE CORE SECTION — 2-4 paragraphs, 400-800 words.
Old logic → New logic → Why now → Endgame.
Include specific data points, management quotes with dates.
Weave in industry chain context naturally.
TAM + market share framing is MANDATORY for this section (even rough estimates).
First-person "我认为..." should appear at least once here.
This section should make the reader say "I get why this company is interesting RIGHT NOW."
Governance-change observations from risk analysis may appear here if structurally relevant.
**END this section with**: the `我与市场的分歧` mandatory 1-2 sentence paragraph (bolded) — OR place it at the start of 估值情况 if that fits better narratively. Pick ONE placement.]

## 运营逻辑
[2-4 paragraphs + capacity-ramp table, 400-700 words.
Capacity by facility, capex cadence, utilization targets.
Bottom-up unit economics for commodity/industrial names (use commodity-math-template.md).
Operating leverage decomposition: "from Q1 to Q4, revenue +$XM, net income +$YM, incremental margin ~Z%".
This section answers: "HOW does the business logic convert into P&L, and when?"]

## 客户与订单
[1-2 paragraphs + 1-2 tables, 300-500 words.
Named top-5 customers with revenue share and strategic significance.
Contract/backlog walk: $X backlog split by contract, with 2025 vs 2026 contribution.
Customer CAPEX cycle: are key customers in expansion mode?
If customer names are not disclosed, use segment or geography as proxy AND state the limitation.]

## 财务数据
[Tables + 2-3 paragraphs commentary, 400-600 words.
3-year financial comparison: Revenue, Gross Margin, EBITDA, Net Income, EPS, FCF.
Forward model table with explicit growth drivers in column headers.
Management guidance (with date of guidance).
2-3 key earnings call quotes with dates and speakers.
EMBED the short-seller risk grade as one-line: "做空风险评级: [A/B/C/D/F]—[one-line verdict]"
If risk grade C+, expand to a full paragraph with named red flags.]

## 估值情况
[2-3 paragraphs + tables, 400-700 words.
Lead with the ONE primary valuation method (chosen by archetype).
Derivation with every input named and **math done inline in prose**: "2027E EPS $X × 历史平均 P/E 29x = 目标价 $Y (我认为 29x 不激进因为 [reason])".
Parenthetical confidence asides are encouraged: "(我认为这已经很保守了)", "(按 250 亿整数估算,方便计算)", "(我不求吃完,只求 [reason])".
Peer comparison table (3-5 peers, 4-6 columns max).
Bull/base/bear in prose (one sentence each) — NOT a probability-weighted table, NOT a "综合公允价值" average.
Multiple re-rating catalyst: what moves the stock from current to target multiple?
For commodity companies, unit-math appears BEFORE multiple work.

**CLOSING LINE REQUIREMENT**: The final sentence of 估值情况 MUST be single-number + upside multiple format, on its own line (not buried inside a bull/base/bear paragraph):
- GOOD: "目前市值 40 亿,我们看到 100 亿,6 倍空间。" / "目标价 $140 (约 2.5×,对应 2026E EPS $5.6 × 25x)。"
- BAD: "三法收敛 ¥7,230-8,700,主推基准 ¥8,700。" / "DCF/EV-EBITDA/SOTP 综合公允价值区间 $X-$Y。"

**SCENARIO DISCIPLINE (NEW)**: Bull/base/bear scenarios are allowed BUT:
- Each scenario is ONE line max (never a 3-row table with bold headers)
- Scenarios appear in the MIDDLE of 估值情况, NOT at the end
- The final line of 估值情况 is ALWAYS the single-number target (not the bull/base/bear range)
- BAD: 牛市场景 $110亿 / 基准场景 $88亿 / 熊市场景 $65亿 presented as a formatted scenario block
- GOOD: "牛市 $110亿 (假设数据中心订单超预期), 熊市 $65亿 (执行滞后). 基准 $88亿,~4倍空间 — 这是我的目标。"]

## 技术分析
[1-2 paragraphs + one small price-level table, 150-200 words.
Monthly / weekly / daily trend.
Current primary pattern with breakout status.
Key support (2) and resistance (2) levels.
Alignment with fundamental thesis in one sentence.
NO Wyckoff vocabulary — translate to 投降 / 反弹 / 回测 / 突破 / 上升.
Do NOT re-explain the trade plan here — that's the final section.]

## 风险提示
[Bullet list, **2-4 items MAX**, 100-200 words. Fewer is better — only thesis-killers.
Each risk: what it is, **observable signal to monitor** (not abstract regulatory/FX/liquidity category).
Format: "风险：1, [specific thing], 2, [specific thing]。" is fine — analysts write it this short.
No scoring matrix. No probability table. No "Red Flag Inventory".
Do NOT include boilerplate "外汇风险/利率风险/地缘风险" unless they are genuine thesis-killers.]

## 交易计划

## STYLE ENFORCEMENT

Read `references/style-guide.md` for the complete style guide. Key rules:

### DO (Analyst Patterns)
- Write as one analyst with conviction. Take a side.
- Use "我们"/"我认为"/"从数据我们看到" for opinions and observations.
- Reference Bloomberg screenshots naturally when provided.
- Use **bold** for key numbers and conclusions.
- Keep paragraphs to 3-5 sentences max.
- Use specific numbers, not ranges when possible.
- End with a trade plan that has entry / stop / TP1 / TP2 / position size.

### DO NOT (Claude Patterns to Avoid)
- Do NOT start with "数据充分性说明" (embed confidence inline).
- Do NOT use "概率加权公允价值" or average 9 methods to get a number.
- Do NOT create separate "Commercial Evidence Table" sections.
- Do NOT create formal "Wyckoff Phase" tables with SC/AR/ST/Spring/SOS labels in the final report.
- Do NOT create "Red Flag Inventory" tables with scores.
- Do NOT create "Financial Quality Sub-Components A/B/C/D/E" as separate sections.
- Do NOT use "本技术分析为基本面分析的补充附录" or any disclaimer mid-report.
- Do NOT hedge conclusions with "需要进一步验证" without specifying what and when.
- Do NOT use section numbering like "第一部分: ..., 第二部分: ..."
- Do NOT repeat the company name/ticker in every section header.
- Do NOT end with a 4-row evaluation matrix. End with a trade plan in prose.

## ANTI-TRUNCATION + VOICE VERIFICATION

Before finalizing the report, run this self-check. A "pass" is either (a) the item is present, OR (b) the item is legitimately unavailable AND the limitation is explicitly stated inline.

### Content checks (truncation prevention)

1. **Customer names** — Did I include every named customer from the fundamental sub-report?
   - **Pass condition (if not disclosed)**: Statement like "客户名称未在 10-K 中披露，使用终端市场作为代理" appears inline in Block C, optionally with Tier-1 or indirect customer context.

2. **Management quotes** — Did every dated, attributed quote from the fundamental sub-report appear in the final report?
   - **Pass condition (if transcripts unavailable)**: "电话会议 transcript 未获取 — 仅使用新闻稿和披露信息" stated inline.

3. **Forward catalysts** — Every dated catalyst from the fundamental sub-report: is it in 业务逻辑 / 运营逻辑 / 交易计划 somewhere?

4. **Valuation inputs** — Every input of the primary valuation method: is it visible in 估值情况?

5. **Trade plan numbers** — Does the final report have explicit entry zone, stop, TP1, TP2, position size?

6. **Technical levels** — Are the 2-3 support and 2-3 resistance levels all in the report?

7. **Green flags** — Did the named green flags from the risk sub-report make it into the final report (embedded in 财务数据 or 业务逻辑)?

8. **Data anomaly flags** — If the source data contains obvious anomalies (identical EPS two years in a row, negative margin percentages, share count discrepancies): is the anomaly flagged inline?
   - **Pass condition**: Anomaly noted in one sentence with "需用户确认数据准确性".

### Voice/conviction checks (analyst-output parity)

9. **First-person voice count** — Does "我"/"我认为"/"我觉得"/"我们" appear at least **6 times** across the report? Count them. If <6, rewrite 业务逻辑 and 估值情况 paragraphs to add conviction markers.

10. **Narrative-tension opener** — Does sentence 1 of 公司简介 start with the pivot/inflection/mispricing? If it starts with founding date, ticker, or HQ location, rewrite.

11. **Where-I-Differ paragraph** — Is there a `我与市场的分歧` paragraph (1-2 sentences, bolded) at the end of 业务逻辑 or start of 估值情况? If missing, the report has no alpha — add it.

12. **Single-number target** — Is the CLOSING LINE of 估值情况 a single number + upside multiple? If it's a range ("区间 ¥X-¥Y") or triangulation ("三法收敛"), rewrite.

13. **Inline arithmetic presence** — Does at least one valuation or operating-leverage calculation appear as inline prose arithmetic ("50 × 0.62 = 31 亿...") rather than a cold ledger table? If all math is in tables, rewrite one chain inline.

14. **Banned-phrase scan** — Run a find on: 综上所述 / 由此可见 / 换言之 / 综合来看 / 值得关注的是 / 读这个表的关键一句话 / 一句话总结 / 业务总结 / 综合评级 / 核心判断 / 长话短说 / 二元期权 / 非对称性极强 / 中性偏负 / 非高确信 / Step 1...Step 5 enumeration. All should be ZERO occurrences.

15. **Specific-date density** — Count specific dates (YYYY-MM or YYYY-Q# format) across the report. Target: **10+ dated milestones**. If fewer than 6, the report is too vague — add dates from sub-reports.

16. **Risk section length** — Is 风险提示 at most 4 items? If 5+, trim to the thesis-killers.

17. **Trade plan single-posture** — Is 评级 a single word (买入 / 持有 / 观望 / 卖出) with no stacked hedges? "中性偏负" / "观望 (Hold / Trade-Only)" / "持有偏积极买入" all FAIL.

If ANY of these fail the pass conditions, the synthesis is broken. Fix it by re-weaving, not by adding a new appendix. Voice checks #9-17 are non-negotiable — reports that fail them read like templated Claude output, not analyst output.

## OUTPUT

**Default format: Markdown (.md)** — easy to review, diff, and iterate. The filename should be `[TICKER]_深度研究报告.md`.

**When to switch to .docx**: The user explicitly asks for a Word document, the task requires a shareable stakeholder file, or the orchestrator is being run in production delivery mode. In that case, use the `anthropic-skills:docx` skill with filename `[TICKER]_深度研究报告.docx`.

If the user provides Bloomberg Terminal data (screenshots or text), integrate it directly into the relevant sections rather than listing it in an appendix.

## HANDLING MISSING OR AMBIGUOUS DATA

**Named customers not disclosed** (e.g., DIOD, most mature semiconductor companies, many industrial names): This is a legitimate disclosure pattern — NOT a skill failure. Pass condition: write "未在公开披露中提及具体客户名称 — 使用终端市场/地理作为代理" inline in Block C (客户与订单), and use end-market percentages or geographic split as proxy. Optionally list Tier-1 customers as indirect strategic context (e.g., "ODM 广达/纬创为主要间接客户", "Tier 1 博世/大陆/安波福为主要采购渠道"). The anti-truncation checklist passes for this item as long as the limitation is explicitly stated.

**Identical consecutive-year data points** (e.g., same EPS two years in a row): Flag inline with one sentence: "注意: FY2024 与 FY2025 GAAP EPS 同为 $X.XX — 需用户确认数据准确性，可能是数据源问题或真实平台期". Do not silently use potentially erroneous data as the basis for valuation.

**Missing Bloomberg terminal data** (consensus, peer multiples, ownership, debt pricing): Continue writing all non-blocked sections. Mark blocked sections inline with "因终端数据缺失，此处仅做框架性估算" — do NOT start the report with a "数据充分性说明" table.
