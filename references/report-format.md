# Report Format — Section-by-Section Guidance (Mainline Structure)

This file defines the depth and content requirements for each section of the analyst-style research report. The report follows a **mainline-driven** structure, not numbered parts (第一/第二/第三/第四部分).

## Title Block

```
[Company Name]（[Ticker]）深度研究报告：
[Subtitle — one-line thesis, e.g., "AI 驱动下的业务逻辑重构与 2026 年市场估值展望"]
```

The subtitle should capture the SINGLE most compelling angle. Examples from real analyst reports:
- "从比特币矿工到AI云新秀" (IREN)
- "北美业务重组下的价值重估" (CSIQ)
- "困境反转的关键阶段" (COMM)
- "数据中心电力需求的隐形赢家" (SEI)
- "需求锁死再扩产的逻辑" (TSEM)
- "锑战略金属 + 白银副产品的双轮驱动" (UAMY)

## Default Mainline Structure

Use this structure for new full reports:

1. Core Conclusion
2. Why This Stock Exists Now
3. Industry Chain And Bottleneck
4. Company Position In The Chain
5. Business Model Logic
6. Scarcity And Moat Assessment
7. Customers, Orders, And Commercialization Path
8. Operations, Capacity, And Execution Quality
9. Financial Quality, Assets, Debt, And Dilution
10. Valuation And Market-Implied Expectation
11. Catalysts, Risks, And Falsification
12. Technical Structure And Trade Plan

Chinese output can translate these headings, but keep the order and logic.

## Alpha Thesis Overlay

Before filling sections, build this compact spine:

```text
market belief -> mispricing thesis -> correct valuation denominator
-> company control point -> demand proxy or order quality
-> operating machine -> EPS/EBITDA/FCF revision bridge
-> alpha case proof event -> broken thesis signal -> trade action
```

The final report must answer:

- what the market is missing or overpaying for
- why the company is not merely thematic beta
- how demand enters revenue, margin, EPS/EBITDA, and FCF
- which proof event would force a re-rating
- which early warning signal would disprove the thesis

Use compact tables when material:

- operating machine table
- demand proxy ladder
- EPS or EBITDA revision bridge
- catalyst calendar
- early warning dashboard

## Core Conclusion

Open with the current repricing dispute, then state action stance, position-size
logic, main upside variable, and main invalidation variable. Do not start with a
generic company history.

## Why This Stock Exists Now

Explain demand expansion, what changed versus the prior 6-12 months, why the
market is paying attention now, and which outside thesis path survived primary
source verification.

## Industry Chain And Bottleneck

Name the industry pain, why existing solutions are insufficient, the scarce
value-chain node, and whether scarcity is temporary, cyclical, or structural.

## Company Position In The Chain

State what the company sells, who pays, why they pay, what cost/risk/delay or
compliance burden they avoid, and whether this is industry beta or company
alpha.

## Business Model Logic

Explain old value driver, new value driver, revenue denominator, margin
mechanism, cash-flow pattern, and falsification observable.

## Scarcity And Moat Assessment

Assess technical, capacity, certification/qualification, customer-relationship,
geographic/policy, switching-cost, and replication barriers.

## Customers, Orders, And Commercialization Path

Separate recognized revenue, binding PO, firm backlog, paid reservation,
contract/framework/IDIQ, pilot/MOU/pipeline, delivery cadence, customer funding,
working-capital burden, and order-to-revenue bridge.

## Operations, Capacity, And Execution Quality

Cover current facilities/assets, current capacity/utilization, expansion plan,
capex source, ramp date, bottleneck, gross margin at scale, and execution risk.

## Financial Quality, Assets, Debt, And Dilution

Cover revenue and margin trend, OCF versus net income, EBITDA-to-OCF-to-FCF,
working capital, capex quality, cash runway, debt maturity, preferred/warrants,
ATM/convertibles, and FCF per share or a blocked conclusion.

## Valuation And Market-Implied Expectation

Start with what the current price already implies. Then use one primary
valuation method, inline arithmetic, EV-to-equity-to-diluted-share bridge,
base/bull/bear cases, re-rating condition, downside floor, and one sanity check.

## Catalysts, Risks, And Falsification

State 3-6 month catalysts, 12-24 month catalysts, thesis-breaking risks,
short-seller attack narrative, and what evidence would prove the thesis wrong.

## Technical Structure And Trade Plan

Cover monthly, weekly, and daily trend, pattern, volume, entry, stop, TP1, TP2,
add/trim logic, position size, action grade, binding cap reason, and
invalidation.

## Legacy Headings

Older report headings such as 公司简介, 业务运营, 行业地位, 业务逻辑重构, 客户结构,
负债结构, 财务数据, 估值情况, 技术分析, 风险提示, and 总结 are legacy aliases.
Use them only when the user explicitly wants the older Chinese structure.

## 公司简介 (Company Overview)

**Length**: 1-2 paragraphs, 100-200 words
**Purpose**: Set context. Reader should know what the company does in 30 seconds.

**Must include**:
- What the company does (one sentence)
- When founded, where headquartered
- Key stats: market cap, revenue, employees (approximate)
- Which exchange/ticker

**Must NOT include**:
- Detailed product descriptions (save for 运营逻辑)
- Financial analysis (save for 财务数据)
- Investment thesis (save for 业务逻辑)

## 业务逻辑 (Business Logic)

**Length**: 2-4 paragraphs, 400-800 words — THIS IS THE LONGEST AND MOST IMPORTANT SECTION
**Purpose**: Tell the transformation story that makes this stock interesting RIGHT NOW.

**Must answer four questions in narrative form** (not as a bullet list):
1. What was the OLD value driver? (with specific data — e.g., "主要赚手机周期的钱")
2. What is the NEW value driver? (with specific data — e.g., "AI 芯片复杂度提升带来的测试收入")
3. What structural change enabled or forced this transformation? (e.g., AI buildout, trade war, technology inflection)
4. If successful, what does the company look like in 3-5 years?

**Must include**:
- Specific data points showing the shift (e.g., "计算类从 SoC 收入 10%→80%")
- Management quotes with dates (e.g., "Greg Smith 在 Q4 2025 电话会中指出...")
- Industry chain context woven in naturally
- Governance observations (from risk sub-report) if structurally relevant — e.g., "公司将法人住所从蒙塔纳州变更为德克萨斯州，反映了其优化资本结构的治理逻辑"
- **TAM + market share framing (MANDATORY)**: For each key end market or product segment, state the TAM size (or relative size) and the company's estimated market share. Explain WHY the company wins design-ins vs. competitors (at least one specific technical or relational reason). Without this, business logic becomes assertion rather than analysis.
  - Example (TER pattern): "ATE 不是简单跟着半导体总收入走，而是更像'收入增量的导数市场'；真正驱动 ATE TAM 的，是客户为了支持更高收入增长而新增的测试产能。"
  - Example (TSEM pattern): "超大规模云服务商对 800G 及 1.6T 光收发器的迫切需求 — SiPho TAM 预计 2027 年达 $20B，公司作为主要代工商占据 ~40% 份额。"

**Must end with a section-closing summary sentence (MANDATORY)**: Every 业务逻辑 section must close with ONE bold conviction-level summary sentence in this format:

> **总结**: [Company] 的核心逻辑是 [X], 当前处于 [Y] 阶段，关键验证变量是 [Z]。

Examples from real analyst reports:
- "**业务总结**: TSEM 是做 AI 数据传输基础设施，RF Infrastructure 是容器，SiPho 是核心增量。"
- "**业务总结**: 这不是先扩产再找需求，而是需求锁死再扩产。"
- "**业务总结**: UAMY 从早期的锑冶炼厂进化为美国本土锑产业链的唯一整合者，叠加银和铜副产品回收。"

This crystallizing line forces the writer to commit to a thesis rather than leave the reader to infer one.

**Patterns from real analyst reports**:
> "TSEM 过去主要赚'传统成熟制程代工的钱'，现在主要赚'AI 基建复杂度提升的钱'。逻辑核心是：需求锁死再扩产，而不是先扩产再找需求。" (TSEM)

> "这不是一个单纯的反弹故事 —— UAMY 从早期的锑冶炼厂进化为美国本土锑产业链的唯一整合者，叠加银和铜副产品回收。" (UAMY)

**If no transformation is happening**: State "公司处于稳定运营模式" and focus on what's changing at the margin.

## 运营逻辑 (Operating Logic)

**Length**: 2-4 paragraphs + capacity-ramp table, 400-700 words
**Purpose**: HOW does the business logic convert into P&L, and when?

**Must include**:
- Capacity by named facility with ramp schedule (e.g., "Thompson Falls 产能从 100 吨/月扩至 300-500 吨/月，Q1 2026 投产")
- Capex cadence (quarterly or annual capex numbers with guidance)
- Utilization targets (e.g., "2026 末预计达到 85% 利用率")
- **Bottom-up unit economics for commodity/industrial names** — see `commodity-math-template.md`
- **Operating leverage decomposition** (incremental margin walk): "从 Q1 to Q4 收入 +$82M，净利润 +$41M，incremental margin ~50%"
- Specific product mix shifts (e.g., "SiPho 收入从 2024 年 $106M 增至 2025 年 $228M，+115%")

### MANDATORY Unit-to-EPS Derivation Chain

For any company whose thesis depends on margin expansion or capacity ramp, the 运营逻辑 section MUST walk from a physical input (utilization %, unit volume, ASP) all the way to EPS — with explicit numerical links at each step. Qualitative descriptions alone are NOT enough. This is the biggest gap between Claude reports and analyst reports.

**Required chain format (5 steps):**

```
Step 1 (PHYSICAL): Utilization 78% → 85% (or: Volume 1.0M lb → 2.0M lb)
    ↓
Step 2 (COST LEVERAGE): Fixed cost absorption improves by $XM (fixed cost base ~$YM × 7ppt uplift)
    ↓
Step 3 (GROSS MARGIN): GM expands from 31.2% → 34.0% (+280bp)
    Gross profit change: $1,680M × 280bp = +$47M
    ↓
Step 4 (EBIT / EBITDA): Operating leverage on SG&A (largely fixed) adds additional $YM
    EBIT change: +$47M + $YM = +$ZM
    EBIT margin: 15% → 18%
    ↓
Step 5 (EPS): After-tax (~21%) / diluted share count (46M)
    EPS change: $ZM × 0.79 / 46M = +$X per share
    2027E EPS: $1.42 + $X = $4.00
```

**Why this chain matters**: Without it, the analyst can't connect "利用率改善" (a vague claim) to "目标价 $100" (a specific number). Every step in the chain should be a math expression the reader can verify.

**Real analyst example (TSEM):**
> "25 年硅光子产能及相关收入 396.3M，未来产能扩大 5 倍…3275.9 × 0.264 = 864.84M…EPS 2025 是 1.93，到 2027 年 7.72，复合增长率是 100%."

This is exactly the level of arithmetic rigor required. The TSEM analyst derives 2027 EPS $7.72 from a physical capacity assumption — not from consensus.

**Pass condition**: If you cannot do the full 5-step chain (because the physical variable is unknown), explicitly state which variable is blocking and what data would unblock it. Do NOT silently use "consensus assumes X" — that hides the analyst's job.

**Capacity ramp table format**:
```
| Facility | Current | 2026 Target | 2027 Target | 投产日期 |
|----------|---------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Thompson Falls | 100 t/mo | 300 t/mo | 500 t/mo | Q1 2026 |
```

**Patterns from analyst reports**:
> "2028 target table: revenue $15.66B → $28.4B, gross profit +207%, 假设 85% 利用率。" (TSEM)

> "2026 production → ~2 million lb U3O8 annually；April 2025 4,604 吨矿石 × 1.64% 品位 = 151,400 lb U3O8 产量。" (UUUU)

## 客户与订单 (Customers & Orders)

**Length**: 1-2 paragraphs + 1-2 tables, 300-500 words
**Purpose**: Who pays this company, and how locked-in is the revenue?

**Must include**:
- **Top-5 customers by NAME** with revenue share and strategic significance
- Contract/backlog walk with delivery cadence (contract-by-contract if disclosed)
- Customer CAPEX trends (are key customers in expansion mode?)
- If customer names are not disclosed, use segment or geography as proxy AND state the limitation explicitly

**Customer table format**:
```
| 客户 | 营收占比 | 趋势 | 战略意义 |
|------|---------|------|---------|
| NVIDIA | ~15% | 快速增长 | AI GPU 测试核心客户 |
| Samsung | 12% | 稳定 | 存储器测试 + SoC 双条线 |
```

**Contract walk format**:
```
| 合约 | 总额 | 2025 交付 | 2026 交付 | 状态 |
|------|------|----------|----------|------|
| DLA IDIQ | $245M | $10M | $50-60M | 首批发货 |
```

**Pattern from analyst reports**:
> "$351.7M 订单储备，其中 2025 年交付 $124M，2026 年交付 $185M，剩余在 2027 年。" (UAMY)

## 财务数据 (Financial Data)

**Length**: Tables + 2-3 paragraphs commentary, 400-600 words
**Purpose**: Show the numbers that support the thesis and flag any quality concerns.

**Must include**:
- **3-year financial comparison table**: Revenue, Gross Margin, EBITDA, Net Income, EPS, FCF
- **Forward model table** with explicit growth drivers in column headers (not just "consensus")
- Management guidance for next period (with date of guidance)
- 2-3 key earnings call quotes with dates and speakers
- **Short-seller risk grade embedded as one line**: "做空风险评级: [A/B/C/D/F]（[score]/100）— [one-line verdict]"
- If risk grade C+, expand to a full paragraph with named red flags

**Table format**:
```
| 指标 | FY2023 | FY2024 | FY2025 | 2026E | 趋势 |
|------|--------|--------|--------|-------|------|
| 收入 ($M) | 1,662 | 1,311 | 1,482 | ~1,680 | 周期底部回升 |
| 毛利率 | 39.6% | 33.2% | 31.2% | ~34% | 底部反转 |
| FCF ($M) | 130 | 46 | 137 | ~160 | 已恢复 |
```

**Forward model table** (MUST have drivers, not just "consensus"):
```
| 指标 | 2026E | 驱动力 |
|------|-------|-------|
| 收入 | $1,680M | 汽车 +24% YoY × 占比 19% + 计算 +25% × 27% + 其他持平 |
| 毛利率 | 34% | 内部晶圆厂利用率从 72% → 82%，摊销降 +300bp |
| EBITDA | $244M | 14.5% 利润率，上行 vs 2025 年 13.1% |
```

## 估值情况 (Valuation)

**Length**: 2-3 paragraphs + 1-2 tables, 400-700 words
**Purpose**: What is this stock worth, and WHY — based on ONE primary method, not an average of 9.

**Must include**:
- **ONE primary valuation method** chosen by company archetype:
  - Semiconductor cyclical → mid-cycle EPS × 10-year average P/E
  - Growth foundry / specialty semi → forward EV/EBITDA with multiple-expansion thesis
  - Mining/commodity → lb/ton × commodity price × margin → EBITDA × peer EV/EBITDA
  - Turnaround → P/FCF or replacement value
  - High-growth SaaS → EV/Revenue with Rule-of-40 check
- **Primary method derivation** with every input named: "2027E EPS $8.34 × 十年平均 PE 29x = 目标价 $242"
- Peer comparison table (3-5 peers, 4-6 columns max)
- Bull/base/bear in prose (one sentence each) — NOT a probability-weighted table
- **Multiple re-rating catalyst**: what moves the stock from current to target multiple?
- For commodity companies, unit-math appears BEFORE multiple work

**Peer table format**:
```
| 公司 | 市值 | 2026E EV/EBITDA | 2026E P/E | 核心差异 |
|------|------|----------------|-----------|---------|
| DIOD | $3.8B | 14.4x | 39.5x | 清洁资产负债表 |
| ON Semi | $28B | 11x | 22x | 规模经济 |
| Vishay | $2.5B | 9x | 18x | 成熟业务 |
```

**Key patterns from analyst reports**:
> "考虑到过去十年公司的平均 PE 是 29 倍，对应 EPS $8.34，目标价约 $242。" (TER)
> "最保守情况下，公司估值应该是 45 亿左右。" (CSIQ)
> "Gen3 BCD → 60% EBITDA margin target → $20B × 30x multiple → ~$60B 市值。" (TSEM)

**Kill these**:
- Do NOT run 9 methods and average them
- Do NOT create a "Probability-Weighted Fair Value" row
- Do NOT label methods as "supplementary / primary / secondary / tertiary" — it's ONE primary method, others are sanity checks at most

## 技术分析 (Technical Analysis)

**Length**: 1-2 paragraphs + one small price-level table, 150-200 words
**Purpose**: What does the chart say, and does it confirm or contradict the thesis?

**Must include**:
- Monthly / weekly / daily trend direction (one sentence each)
- Current primary pattern with breakout status
- 2-3 key support and 2-3 key resistance levels (in small table)
- Whether technicals confirm or contradict the fundamental thesis (one sentence)

**Price level table format**:
```
| 位置 | 价位 | 说明 |
|------|------|------|
| 即时阻力 | $85-88 | 当前突破区域 |
| 主要阻力 | $100 | 心理整数位 |
| 强支撑 | $72-75 | 财报后整理区间 |
```

**NO Wyckoff-phase table in the final report.** Translate to plain Chinese: 投降 → 反弹 → 回测 → 突破 → 上升趋势.

**Pattern from analyst reports**:
> "日线呈现牛旗结构，下方跌破 20 元可以考虑先出来。" (CSIQ)
> "一个不太规则的杯柄结构，同时周线突破。上方在 30 元位置是涨幅满足位。" (IREN)

**Do NOT re-explain the trade plan here** — that belongs in 交易计划 at the end.

## 风险提示 (Risk Summary)

**Length**: Bullet list, 3-5 items, 150-250 words
**Purpose**: What could go wrong?

Each bullet: risk name → severity → what to watch for.

**Kill these**:
- No scoring matrix
- No probability table
- No "Red Flag Inventory"
- No icons (✅/⚠️/⏳)
- No "数据充分性说明"

## 交易计划 (Trade Plan) — REQUIRED ENDING

**Length**: Prose, 200-350 words
**Purpose**: Tell the reader exactly what to DO.

See `trade-plan-template.md` for the exact format. Required fields in this exact order:

- **评级**: 买入 / 持有 / 观望 / 卖出
- **建议仓位**: X-Y% of portfolio (with reasoning)
- **入场区间**: $X-$Y (with reason)
- **止损位**: $Z (corresponding to what invalidates the thesis)
- **第一止盈位**: $A (method, e.g., "基于 2026E EPS × 历史平均 PE")
- **第二止盈位**: $B (method)
- **90 天内最重要催化剂**: single most important event with date
- **做空风险**: letter grade + one line
- Final line only: "本报告仅供研究参考，不构成投资建议。"

**Kill these endings**:
- Do NOT end with a 4-row "综合总结" matrix
- Do NOT end with multiple disclaimers
- Do NOT end with "基于多模型估值分析，概率加权公允价值..."

**Patterns from real analyst reports**:
> "仓位推荐 5% 到 10%。第一个止盈目标 45，第二个目标 55。止损位 18。关键催化剂：Q1 2026 财报验证 Thompson Falls 投产节奏。" (CSIQ-style)
> "先看 100 亿市值。止损 8.6 下方。第一波止盈 15。" (IREN-style)
> "目标价 300，推荐仓位 10-15%。" (DAVE)
