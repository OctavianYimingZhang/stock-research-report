# External Inspirations And License Notes

This repository borrows workflow ideas from public projects, not code.

## Rule

Do not copy third-party source code, long prompt text, images, model weights, or
datasets into this Skill. Use ideas only at the abstraction level of workflow,
quality gates, role separation, and output contracts.

## Attribution Standard

When the Skill mentions external projects in docs, link to the source
repository. Do not imply endorsement or dependency.

## Dependency Standard

The current Skill has no runtime dependency on these projects. If future work
adds code, scripts, models, datasets, or copied text from any external project:

1. verify the license again at implementation time
2. preserve required notices
3. include source attribution
4. isolate third-party code from original Skill instructions
5. document installation and security implications

## Book And CFA Material

Valuation and technical-analysis methods are described as standard formulas and
method-selection rules. Do not copy protected textbook prose from CFA materials,
John Murphy, Steve Nison, Wyckoff literature, or any other book. If a user asks
for exact textbook language, summarize instead and cite the book title.
