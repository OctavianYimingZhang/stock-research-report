# Short-Seller Risk Framework

This reference translates common activist short-seller perspectives into an
investment-report risk module. It is not a fraud accusation template. Every
claim must be sourced.

## Output Modes

### Embedded Mode

Use when red flags are low or moderate.

Output:

```text
Short-Seller Risk: [A/B/C/D/F] grade - [one-sentence verdict].
[One compact paragraph covering balance sheet, earnings quality, governance,
customer/order quality, and named red/green flags.]
```

### Expanded Mode

Use when any of these is true:

- three or more material red flags are present
- OCF materially trails net income for multiple years
- auditor resigned, downgraded, or issued going-concern/qualified language
- management has material undisclosed conflicts or severe promotional behavior
- active SEC/DOJ/regulatory investigation exists
- backlog/contracts are central to valuation but weak or unverifiable
- share count has increased materially and dilution is ongoing

Expanded mode explains how the risk affects valuation or position sizing.

## Letter Grade

| Grade | Meaning |
|---|---|
| A | Clean enough for the report; no material short-seller angle found |
| B | Some monitoring items; not thesis-breaking |
| C | Elevated risk; valuation or position size must be discounted |
| D | High risk; short thesis elements are material |
| F | Critical risk; avoid numeric long target unless issues are resolved |

## Core Checks

Label sensitive claims precisely:

- `verified fact`: directly sourced
- `allegation`: claim made by a short report, lawsuit, regulator, or other
  external party
- `inference`: analyst conclusion derived from verified facts
- `unanswered question`: unresolved item that needs a filing, transcript,
  counterparty confirmation, or market-data source

Do not present an inference as a verified fact.

### 1. Customer And Contract Authenticity

Check:

- named customers in filings vs. press releases
- counterparty disclosure from the other side
- contract form: revenue, PO, backlog, capacity reservation, IDIQ, framework,
  MOU, pilot, LOI
- delivery schedule vs. recognized revenue
- customer prepayments, take-or-pay terms, cancellation rights, and procurement
  authority
- concentration above 10%, 20%, and 50%
- customer credit quality and procurement authority

Common risk pattern: promotional contract announcements without disclosed value,
counterparty confirmation, revenue conversion, or purchase obligation.

For government, policy-linked, or procurement-led demand, verify budget source,
award status, prime/subcontract position, certification requirement, and whether
the company is selling directly or through another vendor.

### 2. Revenue Recognition And Round-Tripping

Check:

- revenue-recognition policy
- gross vs. net presentation
- related vendor/customer relationships
- two-way contracts where the company is both buyer and seller
- deferred revenue vs. recognized revenue
- quarter-end concentration
- rebates, credits, channel incentives, bill-and-hold, or distributor stuffing

If revenue grows while receivables, contract assets, or inventory grow much
faster, explain the working-capital risk.

### 3. Cash Flow Quality

Read `ProfitCashFlowQualityAnalysis` before assigning the final grade.

Check:

- cumulative OCF vs. cumulative net income
- EBITDA -> OCF -> FCF bridge
- FCF margin and FCF conversion
- CFO conversion ratio
- FCF after maintenance capex
- working-capital drivers
- DSO, DIO, DPO, inventory, receivables, and contract assets
- capitalized costs
- non-GAAP add-backs
- stock-based compensation
- SBC-adjusted FCF and FCF per share
- diluted shares outstanding and per-share cash-flow dilution

OCF consistently below net income is not proof of fraud, but it is a strong
quality warning that must be explained.

### 4. Balance Sheet And Dilution

Check:

- cash, restricted cash, and burn rate
- short-term and long-term debt
- debt maturity wall
- interest coverage
- covenants
- preferred stock, convertibles, warrants
- ATM or shelf registration
- share count growth over 1, 3, and 5 years
- short interest, borrow availability/cost, failures to deliver, and options
  skew where reliable market data is available

Dilution matters twice: it funds survival and changes per-share upside.

### 5. Governance And Related Parties

Check:

- auditor identity, tenure, changes, and PCAOB issues if relevant
- material weaknesses and restatements
- board independence
- executive compensation vs. revenue/market cap
- insider ownership, pledges, and selling
- related-party sales, purchases, leases, acquisitions, financing, or shared
  addresses
- SPAC/reverse-merger origin and business pivots

Do not imply wrongdoing without evidence. State the verified governance fact and
why it matters.

### 6. Promotion Versus Execution

Check:

- press release frequency vs. material revenue conversion
- paid media, celebrity marketing, or unusually promotional investor relations
- repeated missed milestones
- vague "pipeline", "strategic partnership", or "AI/defense/policy" language
  without commercial conversion
- management selling during promotional periods

Promotion is a risk only when it outruns verifiable execution.

Compare every major narrative claim with one execution metric: shipped units,
recognized revenue, gross margin, OCF, customer payment, capacity utilization,
or recurring reorder. A narrative that cannot be tied to an execution metric is
a short-risk monitoring item.

### 7. Legal, Regulatory, Sanctions, And Policy

Check:

- litigation and regulatory investigations
- sanctions or restricted-customer exposure
- permits, certification, reimbursement, or government-procurement gates
- policy subsidy dependence
- changes in law or procurement rules

If policy is central to valuation, specify what happens if policy support
changes.

## Falsification Lens

For each major upside thesis, name the fact pattern that would make a short
seller's attack stronger:

- announced orders do not convert into revenue
- revenue converts but gross margin or OCF disappoints
- capex rises faster than customer funding
- customer concentration increases instead of diversifying
- policy support changes or certification is delayed
- related-party sales, purchases, or financing become material
- dilution funds operating losses rather than asset-backed expansion
- inventory builds ahead of sell-through evidence

Use these as risk tests, not accusations. The final report should state what
would need to be monitored after publication.

## Red Flag Inventory

Use named red flags, not vague risk language:

- fabricated or unverified customer/contract
- related-party transaction not clearly disclosed
- revenue grows while cash conversion deteriorates
- DSO or inventory growth materially exceeds revenue growth
- repeated capital raises with weak per-share economics
- auditor resignation/downgrade/restatement/material weakness
- insider selling or pledged shares during promotion
- margin far above peers without operating explanation
- regulatory gate presented as realized economics
- backlog counted before binding conversion evidence

## Green Flag Inventory

Name offsetting positives:

- net cash balance sheet
- Big 4 or strong auditor with stable tenure
- clean OCF conversion
- binding backlog with delivery history
- customer confirmation from official counterparty source
- insider ownership with limited selling
- low dilution and no near-term maturity wall
- paid capacity reservations or take-or-pay commitments
- transparent segment reporting

## Integration With Valuation

Short-seller risk must affect the report:

- A/B grade: mention as financial-quality support
- C grade: discount multiple, reduce position size, or require milestone
  confirmation
- D/F grade: avoid high-conviction target unless the issue is resolved

Also state the most plausible activist-short attack narrative in one sentence.
If the company is clean, the sentence should explain why that narrative is weak.

Do not bury material red flags only in `Risk Factors`; place them where they affect
business logic, order quality, debt safety, or valuation.

## Short Attack Narrative Workflow

Run this workflow even when the final short-risk grade is clean:

1. Build the clean bull thesis in one sentence.
2. Build the plausible short attack in one sentence.
3. Separate verified fact, allegation, inference, and unanswered question.
4. Test the attack against customer authenticity, revenue recognition, cash
   conversion, debt/dilution, governance, and promotion/execution gap.
5. Assign grade A/B/C/D/F.
6. If grade is C, D, or F, force valuation haircut or position-size cap.
7. Add early warning signals that would strengthen the short attack.

Required output:

```markdown
Short-seller attack narrative:
[One sentence]

Verdict:
[A/B/C/D/F] because [specific evidence], with [valuation/size effect].
```

## Accounting Optics Expansion Mode

Use expanded mode when reported optics differ from economic ownership,
especially for VIEs, NCI, redeemable NCI, consolidated losses, common-stockholder
income, non-recourse debt, tax equity claims, management-defined asset values,
or project-finance timing explanations.

1. Name the optical issue: for example, common-stockholder EPS positive while
   consolidated economics are weak, or management asset value depends on
   partner/NCI allocation.
2. Separate verified fact, management explanation, inference, unanswered
   question, and plausible short attack.
3. Identify whether the issue affects valuation denominator, position size, or
   only monitoring.
4. State what evidence would weaken or strengthen the short attack.
