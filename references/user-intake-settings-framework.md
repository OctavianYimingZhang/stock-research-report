# User Intake And Settings Framework

This reference converts a vague research request into a controlled
`ResearchSettings` object, optional `UserHypothesis` objects, a source preflight,
and an `OutputView`.

## Core Rule

Runtime settings configure the run. They are not evidence.

User hypotheses are questions to test. They are not verified facts.

User-uploaded documents may become `SourceDocument` objects. User opinions may
only become `UserHypothesis` objects until supported or contradicted by
evidence.

## Presets

Use these preset entry points:

| Preset | Internal mode | Output view |
|---|---|---|
| Full Deep Research | `full_report` | `full_report` |
| Incremental Refresh | `incremental_refresh` | `incremental_refresh_summary` |
| Valuation Memo | `valuation_only` | `valuation_memo` |
| Short-Seller Audit | `short_risk_only` | `short_seller_attack_memo` |
| Trade Plan | `technical_only` | `trade_plan_only` |
| Scorecard Summary | `full_report` | `scorecard_summary` |
| Evidence Gap Scan | `gap_scan` | `evidence_gap_report` |

Do not ask many questions up front. Capture the preset, ticker, exchange or
listing context if supplied, and any user focus areas. Ask follow-up questions
only when a missing input blocks a required conclusion.

## Required Settings

`ResearchSettings` must include:

- `report_language`
- `research_mode`
- `output_view`
- `source_policy`
- `opportunity_policy`
- `valuation_policy`
- `short_risk_policy`
- `technical_policy`
- `incremental_refresh_mode`
- `user_risk_budget_or_gap`
- `citation_detail_level`
- `interaction_level`

Default settings:

- source policy: primary public sources first
- historical reports: style only
- opportunity policy: route the archetype and run the four-part opportunity test
- valuation policy: block target if share count, net debt, senior claims,
  debt maturity, or order quality cannot be reconciled
- short-risk policy: expand if grade is C or worse
- technical policy: current chart data with chart date and adjusted status
- interaction level: ask only for blocking gaps

## Output Views

Supported views:

- `full_report`
- `valuation_memo`
- `short_seller_attack_memo`
- `trade_plan_only`
- `scorecard_summary`
- `evidence_gap_report`
- `source_conflict_report`
- `incremental_refresh_summary`

All output views read the same object graph. The view changes projection only.
It must not change factual source of truth, valuation strictness, gate results,
or evidence lineage.

## Preflight Contract

Before source extraction, create a preflight state with:

- resolved or unresolved company identity
- security and listing context
- required source classes
- uploaded source classes
- expected public source classes to fetch
- likely blockers
- selected output view
- planned sections or omitted sections

Typical blockers:

- unresolved share count
- unresolved net debt
- missing debt maturity schedule for a levered company
- weak order evidence used for valuation
- stale or missing chart data for trade levels
- unresolved primary-source conflict

The agent may continue with non-blocked sections, but blocked targets, trade
levels, or high-conviction conclusions must remain blocked.

## Intake Workflow

Use the minimum-question intake:

1. If ticker is supplied, resolve company, security, exchange, and listing
   context automatically.
2. If output view is not supplied, default to `full_report`.
3. If the user provides an article, manual report, or note, treat it as an
   outside thesis path until verified.
4. If the user asks for a trade plan, require current chart data or mark trade
   levels blocked.
5. If the user asks for valuation target, require share count, net debt, senior
   claims, and order quality, or block the target.
6. Ask follow-up only when missing input blocks the requested output.
7. Otherwise proceed and mark blockers explicitly in the report.

## Prompt Builder Contract

When settings are supplied through UI or configuration, build a canonical prompt
with these fields:

- ticker or company identifier
- exchange or listing context if supplied
- research mode
- output view
- horizon
- source policy
- opportunity policy
- valuation policy
- short-risk policy
- technical policy
- interaction level
- user focus areas

The canonical prompt is a run instruction. It does not override evidence rules.

## Progress Status Contract

During a long run, show user-facing progress through object and gate status:

- Bronze source snapshots
- Source Index partitions
- Silver evidence and claims
- Gold analysis objects
- Report View projection
- gate results
- blockers

Do not expose hidden reasoning. Show only objects created, gates passed,
warnings, blockers, and source gaps.

## Follow-Up Actions

After a report, supported follow-up actions are:

- show evidence gaps
- refresh with a new source
- project valuation memo from the same graph
- project trade plan from the same graph after chart refresh
- project short-seller attack memo from the same graph
- export a source map or evidence ledger summary

Follow-up actions should reuse the existing graph through incremental refresh
unless the new source invalidates a high-materiality claim.
