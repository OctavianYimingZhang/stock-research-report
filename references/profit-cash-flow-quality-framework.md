# Profit Cash Flow Quality Framework

This reference defines the profit-to-cash-flow layer used before valuation,
short-seller risk, decision scoring, and trade planning. Its object is
`ProfitCashFlowQualityAnalysis`.

The goal is to determine whether reported earnings translate into owner cash
flow and whether per-share economics survive working-capital needs, capex, SBC,
and dilution.

## Required Analysis Lenses

The report must cover these lenses when data is available:

- OCF / net income: compare operating cash flow with net income for the latest
  period and cumulatively across the analysis window.
- EBITDA -> OCF -> FCF: reconcile EBITDA to operating cash flow and then to
  free cash flow, naming working-capital, tax, interest, lease, and capex
  drivers.
- FCF quality: distinguish recurring FCF from one-time working-capital release,
  asset sale proceeds, deferred capex, or unusually low cash tax.
- FCF margin and FCF conversion: compute free cash flow as a percentage of
  revenue and as a percentage of EBITDA or net income.
- Working-capital cycle: explain DSO, DIO, DPO, inventory, receivables, payable
  timing, contract assets, deferred revenue, and customer prepayments.
- Capex / D&A: compare capex with depreciation and amortization and state
  whether current capex appears maintenance-like, growth-like, catch-up, or
  temporarily suppressed.
- Maintenance versus growth capex: do not call all capex discretionary when the
  company needs it to sustain capacity, certification, safety, compliance, or
  customer commitments.
- Rule of 40 applicability: use `not_applicable` when the business is not a
  software or subscription model where revenue growth plus FCF margin is a
  relevant quality screen.
- SBC-adjusted FCF: subtract stock-based compensation from free cash flow when
  dilution is economically meaningful.
- FCF per share: divide owner FCF by diluted or pro-forma shares, not basic
  shares when warrants, convertibles, preferred stock, or ATM issuance matter.
- Diluted shares outstanding: reconcile current and pro-forma share count before
  making any per-share owner cash-flow claim.

## Object Contract

`ProfitCashFlowQualityAnalysis` should contain:

- `ocf_to_net_income_reconciliation`
- `ebitda_to_ocf_to_fcf_bridge`
- `fcf_margin_or_conversion`
- `working_capital_cycle`
- `capex_quality`
- `maintenance_vs_growth_capex`
- `sbc_adjusted_fcf`
- `fcf_per_share`
- `diluted_share_count_effect`
- `rule_of_40_applicability`
- `cash_quality_verdict`
- `valuation_effect`
- `short_risk_effect`

The object reads from `MetricObservation`, `FinancialQualityAssessment`,
`DebtInstrument`, `DilutionInstrument`, and evidence-backed `Claim` objects.
It writes a verdict that can support or block `ValuationCase`,
`ShortSellerAssessment`, `RiskFilterAssessment`, and `TradePlan`.

## Profit-To-Cash Workflow

Run this before valuation and short-risk grading:

1. Build a financial trend table for revenue, gross margin, EBITDA, net income,
   OCF, capex, FCF, working capital, SBC, diluted shares, cash, and debt.
2. Reconcile net income to OCF.
3. Reconcile EBITDA to OCF and then FCF.
4. Identify working-capital drivers: receivables, inventory, payables, contract
   assets, deferred revenue, and customer prepayments.
5. Separate maintenance capex, growth capex, catch-up capex, and speculative capex.
6. Compute owner FCF after maintenance capex and economically recurring SBC.
7. Compute owner FCF per diluted or pro-forma share.
8. Decide valuation effect: mature cash flow, transitional cash flow, or unreliable cash flow.
9. Decide short-risk effect: clean, monitor, red flag, or blocked.

| Metric | Latest period | Prior period | TTM | Judgment |

```

## Management Metric Reconciliation Workflow

Use this workflow whenever a management-defined metric drives action grade,
valuation denominator, upside case, downside case, or position size.

Common metrics include Cash Generation, Contracted Net Earning Assets,
Aggregate Subscriber Value, Contracted Net Value Creation, Net Earning Assets
per share, adjusted EBITDA, recurring cash flow, and management-defined FCF.

1. Identify the management metric, period, definition, reported value, and
   source.
2. Decide whether the report conclusion depends on the metric. If yes,
   reconciliation is mandatory.
3. Build the GAAP and cash bridge:

```text
management metric -> GAAP revenue -> consolidated net income/loss
-> common-stockholder net income -> NCI / redeemable NCI allocation
-> operating cash flow -> investing cash flow -> financing cash flow
-> parent cash / unrestricted cash -> equity-owner cash
```

4. Classify the metric quality: clean recurring, timing-dependent,
   financing-dependent, accounting-allocation-dependent, non-cash, or low
   valuation usability.
5. Classify report use: base case, alpha case, monitoring variable, or blocked
   valuation.

Required object:

```yaml
ManagementMetricReconciliation:
  metric_name:
  management_definition:
  period:
  reported_value:
  GAAP_anchor:
  cash_flow_anchor:
  equity_owner_anchor:
  adjustments:
  NCI_or_VIE_effect:
  timing_dependency:
  recurring_quality:
  valuation_use:
  blocker_reason:
```

If common-stockholder EPS diverges materially from consolidated economics, or
cash generation is negative but called timing, the report must state the next
proof date before using the metric in valuation.

## Interpretation Rules

Positive quality signals:

- OCF is consistently close to or above net income.
- FCF remains positive after maintenance capex.
- Working-capital release is not the main source of cash generation.
- Capex supports visible customer demand or asset productivity.
- Customer prepayments, grants, or paid reservations fund expansion before the
  company carries the full cash burden.
- Inventory build is matched to signed orders, production ramps, or disclosed
  delivery schedules.
- Diluted share count is stable or accretion offsets dilution.
- SBC-adjusted FCF remains positive.

Negative quality signals:

- Net income grows while OCF deteriorates.
- Receivables, inventory, or contract assets grow materially faster than
  revenue.
- FCF depends on delayed payables, deferred capex, or one-time cash inflows.
- Capex is described as growth but is required to maintain operations.
- Inventory or contract assets rise before evidence of customer conversion.
- Customer-funded capex is assumed but not supported by payment terms.
- SBC or financing dilution turns firm-level cash flow into weak per-share cash
  flow.
- The company reports strong adjusted EBITDA while cash flow stays weak.

These signals are not fraud claims by themselves. They determine valuation
confidence, short-seller vulnerability, and position sizing.

## Valuation Integration

Before selecting a primary valuation method, decide whether cash flow is mature,
transitional, or unreliable:

- Mature cash flow can support P/FCF, FCFF, FCFE, EV/EBITDA, or shareholder
  yield methods.
- Transitional cash flow may support EV/EBITDA only if the bridge to future FCF
  is explicit.
- Unreliable cash flow should cap multiple expansion, reduce position size, or
  block a high-conviction target.

For per-share value, use owner cash flow:

```text
owner FCF = operating cash flow - maintenance capex - economically recurring SBC
owner FCF per share = owner FCF / diluted or pro-forma shares
```

If maintenance capex cannot be separated from growth capex, state the gap and
use total capex as the conservative default for sanity checking.

## Ramp-Stage Cash Discipline

For companies transitioning from small revenue to contracted ramp, separate
strategic cash from operating cash:

- cash raised for expansion
- cash produced by operations
- cash locked in working capital
- cash required for committed capex
- cash protected by customer prepayment, grants, or credits
- cash consumed before the next revenue milestone

Use this bridge:

```text
net cash runway = cash and marketable securities + expected near-term OCF
  + verified customer funding or grants
  - committed capex
  - working-capital build
  - debt maturities
```

If cash runway is strong but per-share dilution is large, state both facts. A
fortress balance sheet can reduce bankruptcy risk while still capping per-share
upside.

## Short-Seller And Scorecard Integration

Cash-flow quality feeds the forensic screen. A weak OCF / net income pattern,
rapid DSO/DIO expansion, aggressive capitalization, or recurring dilution should
be tested as a short-seller risk signal.

Cash-flow quality also feeds `DecisionScorecard`. Strong business logic cannot
receive a high action grade when owner FCF is negative, cash conversion is
unexplained, or per-share dilution offsets operating progress. The scorecard
must state the binding cap reason instead of hiding the issue in a generic risk
paragraph.
